OpenGL class work

Post Mortem:
Things were hard while the actual lecturing part was happening, trying to keep up with what we were learning and everything. But, once that was over and there was time to just focus on the gaps everything made sense. If I had to do this again I'd comment more and instead of trying to keep up with how fast Esme is typing and listening to whats being said, I would just listen then copy the code off github later, which I did the last week or two. I wish this opportunity with Justin's boss hadnt been during this assessment because it took my time away from it to work on the VR game but I am glad it atleast came along after the instruction part was finished.
